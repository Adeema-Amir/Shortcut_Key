If the source control in our VsCode is not working either not showing up any thing then the best remedy to do it is as following:

Step 1:
          Open the extensions from side bar of Vs code
          
Step 2:
          Search there an extension named as  " @builtin git "
          
Step 3:
          Open the extension whose name is "GIT" and in description name is "Git SCM Integration" 
          
Step 4:
          It will be 'Disabled' enable it by clicking the button
          
Step 5:
          Again 'refresh' the explorer and open the source control now the errror will be resolved!!
