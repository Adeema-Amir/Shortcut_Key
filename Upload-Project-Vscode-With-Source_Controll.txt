-----------------Here are some additional tips for uploading a project to GitHub with VSCode:-----------------



If you are uploading a large project, you may want to use the

"Incremental Sync" option.

This will only upload the changes that you have made since your last commit.

If you are uploading a project that contains sensitive information, you may want to encrypt your repository.

This will prevent anyone from viewing the contents of your repository without your permission.

You can also use VSCode to collaborate on projects with other people.

To do this, you will need to create a new repository and invite your collaborators.
