

When I modified my next.config.js file and added some env configurations I started having this issue "Parsing error : Cannot find module 'next/babel'"

Then i resolved this error by following these steps:
 
 1- First of all I created a file at my root structure named as:
       " .babelrc "
 
 2- Then in this file I wrote down the following code:
     "
       {
           "presets": ["next/babel"],
            "plugins": []
       } 
     "
 
 3- After this in my " .eslintrc.json " which was having its default code, I replaced it with my following code:
     "
       {
          "extends": ["next/babel","next/core-web-vitals"]
       }
    
     "
     
 4- Finally! then I restarted my server refreshed my Vscode saved all the files killed my terminal, started again and the error was just gone...!!!
